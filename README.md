# TWEB - TE2
Author : Bryan Curchod

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.7.

Unfortunately I couldn't finish the project, here's a list of what's missing : 
- Film filtering in the upcomming page
- Favorite persistence when returning on the popular page
- **D E P L O Y M E N T**
- Pagination (get the nexts pages)

# Launching the project
in a command prompt, get to the root folder and simply run these commands : 
```cmd
npm install
ng serve --open
```
NB : you may need to install the Angular CLI to run the second command : 
```cmd
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
